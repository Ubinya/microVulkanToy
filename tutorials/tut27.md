# Alpha Blending and Transparency - Tutorial 27

By setting a fragment's alpha to a value in between 0 and 1 we can render semi-transparent objects. Unfortunately things arenâ€™t that simple. When working with semi-transparent objects, the order in which we render them actually matters!

In this tutorial we add a limited blending capability to our point light system, allowing them to be rendered with a nicer appearance.
